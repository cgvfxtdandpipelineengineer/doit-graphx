TODOs
=====
- Change default action from matplotlib to json-text.
- Pass kw-options from cmd-line to `nx.store_XXX()` methods.
- Make matplotlib as a setup-tools "extra" feature.
- Add graphviz graphs (also as "extra").
- Add more tests, setup Travis, add Docs contents.
- The networkx's ``write_XXX()`` methods are untested.
- Task-selection is wrong (ie private works only when task-names given).
